- 👋 Hi, I’m Hasan Motam. I'm a 23 year old student in Aerospace Engineering (MEng) at the University of Surrey. I have gotten myself into computational science and engineering (CSE). It's so important and exciting that I'm taking the Machine Learning/AI Engineer career path on codecademy (and using a bunch of their other resources) to learn software engineering, python, machine learning, AI and more! I'm also learning traditional CSE such as engineering mathematics, numerical methods and engineering simulations. In my spare time, I love to fish (I'm becoming somewhat of an avid angler - reach out if you're interested!), lift weights and cook nutritious foods.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven science and engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a message here or email me at hasan.motam@outlook.com
